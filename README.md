# Arduino---Ball-And-Plate
A robot that can balance a ball on a specific spot on a platform.

Hello!
Thank you for taking a look at our arduino school project!

This robot balances a ball on a specific spot on a platform. This platform can rotate in all directions using two servos.
It uses a camera called Pixy to determen the position of the ball. Arduino will then use PID to calculate the distance between
the ball and the spot it needs to balance on. It will then send a signal to the servos wich will then take adjust their positions.

We got an A for this project. We also won a prize for the best project this year!

Bye!
